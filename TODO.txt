Option 1: Conservative Optimization (Recommended)
yaml
# Redistribute unused resources to where they might be needed
api01 & api02:
  cpus: '0.65'     # +0.05 each for peak load handling
  memory: '90MB'   # -10MB each (still 2.5x current usage)

postgres:
  cpus: '0.15'     # -0.05 (currently using only 3.5%)
  memory: '120MB'  # +20MB for better caching/buffers

nginx:
  cpus: '0.05'     # -0.05 (currently using only 2.4%)
  memory: '50MB'   # Keep same (adequate for current usage)

Total: 1.5 CPU, 350MB (within constraints)


Option 2: Aggressive Optimization
yaml
# Maximize efficiency based on actual usage patterns
api01 & api02:
  cpus: '0.7'      # More CPU for potential spikes
  memory: '80MB'   # Still 2.3x current usage

postgres:
  cpus: '0.05'     # Minimal (very efficient)
  memory: '150MB'  # More memory for database operations

nginx:
  cpus: '0.05'     # Minimal (extremely efficient)
  memory: '40MB'   # Reduce slightly

Total: 1.5 CPU, 350MB
